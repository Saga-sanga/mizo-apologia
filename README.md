## Overview


### Getting Started

npm install
```

* Start the development server

```

### The purpose

Mizo Apologia is a website created to be a repository of Bible answers to questions concerning faith, religion and doctrine. The website is built for the Mizo community therefore the content might be inaccessable to non native speakers.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size.
- Submit a question via a form.
- View each page containing answers and articles.
